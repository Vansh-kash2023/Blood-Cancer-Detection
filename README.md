# Deep Learning Models Repository

This repository contains implementations of five deep learning models using Jupyter Notebooks. Each model is trained and evaluated for specific tasks, showcasing different neural network architectures.

## Models Implemented

1. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** - Used for image classification and feature extraction.
2. **SEQCNN (Sequential CNN)** - A variation of CNN optimized for sequential data processing.
3. **FFNN (Feedforward Neural Network)** - A fully connected network for tabular data processing.
4. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** - A recurrent neural network model designed for time-series and sequential data.
5. **BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)** - An enhanced LSTM model that processes input data in both forward and backward directions.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed. The required libraries can be installed manually using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter seaborn
```

Alternatively, install any missing dependencies when running the notebooks.

## Running the Notebooks

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vansh-kash2023/Blood-Cancer-Detection.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open and run the desired `.ipynb` file:
   - `CNN.ipynb`
   - `SEQCNN.ipynb`
   - `FFNN.ipynb`
   - `LSTM.ipynb`
   - `BiLSTM.ipynb`

## Dataset

Ensure the dataset is available in the repository or update the paths inside the notebooks to load your dataset correctly.

## Results

Each notebook contains training and evaluation results, including accuracy and loss graphs.
